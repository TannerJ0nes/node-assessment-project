The events Module
Description:
The events module is a core global object in Node.js that facilitates event-driven programming. It provides a framework for working with events, event emitters, and event listeners. This module is crucial for handling asynchronous and event-based tasks in Node.js.

Usage:

Event emitters: You can create custom event emitters to emit events when specific actions or conditions occur in your code.
Event listeners: The events module allows you to register event listeners to listen for and respond to emitted events.
Asynchronous event handling: It's commonly used for managing asynchronous tasks and callbacks in a clean and organized way.
